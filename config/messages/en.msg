HomeSummary: An advanced purely-functional programming language
HomeTag: Declarative, statically typed code.
HomeCodeSample: This example is contrived in order to demonstrate what Haskell looks like, including: (1) where syntax, (2) enumeration syntax, (3) pattern matching, (4) consing as an operator, (5) list comprehensions, (6) infix functions. Don't take it seriously as an efficient prime number generator.
